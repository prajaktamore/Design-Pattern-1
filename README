PURPOSE:
[
Generic XML Serializer 
 1)create one instance each for MyAllTypesFirst and MyAllTypesSecond
 2) create Dynamic Proxy
 3) call writeXML with an instance of MyAllTypesFirst
 4) call readXML and compare the returned object with the one that was serialized
 5) compare the serialized and deserialized object
 6) call writeXML with an instance of MyAllTypesSecond
 7) call readXML and compare the returned object with the one that was serialized
 8)  compare the serialized and deserialized object 
]

PERCENT COMPLETE:
[
  I believe we have completed the project 100%, we have implemented entire functionality.
  According to the specific required two design patterns are applied 
  1. proxy 
]

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:
[
  None.
]

BUGS:
[
	Known bugs N/A  
]

FILES:
[

  Included with this project are 27 files:
  	Driver.java 			Driver class that calls Invoke handler to the createProxy() utility method,also driver class will call compare method which will compare the returned object with the one that was serialized for specific Intance
  	ICheckUserInput.java 	Interface that checks the input validity
	ICompareTwoClasses.java Interface that Compare two classes
	DeserXML.java 		    Interface for Deseralize
	SerDeserXML.java 		Tag Interface
	SerXML.java 		Interface for Serialize class
	DeSerialize.java 		DeSerialize class that uses reflection to generate classes and calls respective methodfrom the parsed data
	Serialize.java 			Serialize class that Serialize data and generate MyAllTypesCopy.txt
	MyAllTypesFirst.java 	MyAllTypeFirst POJO class
	MyAllTypesSecond.java 	MyAllTypesSecond POJO class
	CatchWrongInputException.java User Defined exception class, That validates input data
	CheckUserInput.java 	Checks the input validity
	CompareTwoClasses.java  Compares the arraylists to find uniqueInstance
	Debug.java 				Debugger class that maintains logging information
	FileReaderClass.java 	FileReaderClass tis contains objects of FileReader and BufferedReader
	XMLHandler.java         Invocation handler (an instance of XMLHandler) to the createProxy() utility method
	ProxyCreator			ProxyCreator utility class to create a dynamic proxy reference
	SerializableObject		Empty abstract class
	build.xml				Code for ANT compilation and for setting command line arguments.
	README					The text file that you are currently reading.
    myAllTypesA.txt          Input file
    myAllTypesB.txt          Input file
    MyAllTypes.txt			Get Format
]

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

[
	myAllTypesA.txt generated by serialization which is same as input file to deserialize, and the return is compared 
	myAllTypesB.txt generated by serialization which is same as input file to deserialize, and the return is compared
[java]  After method :: writeXML
[java]  After method :: writeXML
[java]  After method :: readXML
[java]  Both are Equal
[java]  After method :: readXML
[java]  Both are Equal 

]

TO COMPILE:

[
  Extract the project and go to the directory(using CD Command) where you have extracted the project.
  
  Please Compile as: ant compile
  
]

TO RUN:

[
  Please run as: ant -Darg0=2 run
  Change -Drg0
  1 : No output is printed
  2 : Result from searialize and Desearialize is Compared and output is printed 
  3 : All called constructors are called
]

EXTRA CREDIT:

[

Used Proper proxy pattern

Debug is implemented properly

serialization,deserialization and comparison is working correct

Used System.exit(0) for every catch block

Overriden toString() in every class 

NULL checks are done whenever required

Overriden equals and hashcode method while comparing unique Instances

Program to Interface and not to concrete class

Input validation with user defined Exception handling
